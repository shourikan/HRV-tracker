This outlier required correction of the motion detection code.

Changes:
	-More efficient processing (no effect on the resulting data)
	-Motion definition: general motion >> vertical motion[y] (increased accuracy of resulting data)
	-Color treshold correction: Light green >> dark green[bottom of LED] (increased accuracy of resulting data)
